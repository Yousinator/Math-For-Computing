## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2019/04/Multiplication_1920x1080_Lede.gif)


These are Mathematical algorithms that are used in the programming field. All algorithms are written in both C and Java. For each folder that contains more than one algorithm, there will be a separate file for each algorithm with precise documentation on how the algorithm was written.



## ðŸ’¡Detailed INFO:

``` Number Systems Calculator -> The number systems calculator converts numbers from system to system. The code is available both in C and Java. In Progress... ```
##
``` Symmetric Encryption -> It includes a code that encrypts messages symmetrically (Public Key Encryption). In Progress... ```
##
``` RSA Encryption -> Includes a code that performs RSA Encryption using the modular inverse (Public & Private Key Encryption). In Progress... ```
##
``` Sequences -> In Progress... ```
##
``` Hashing -> In Progress... ```
##
```Load Balancing -> In Progress... ```
##


## Built With

For this project, I used both C lang and Java. The C code is mainly for me as I like the language and I want to use it. As for Java, I used it to provide a GUI for each code.

* [Java]()

## Getting Started

Getting started with this is very simple. Just navigate to the section you'd like to check out and you'll find documentation for each algorithm.

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to be familiar with the algorithms that you are checking out as algorithms won't be explained mathematically. Documentation will only include explanation from a programming perspective. 

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```
2. Viola that's it!!


## Usage

This repository can be used with certain projects that require certain mathematical algorithms. This repo has the algorithms written in both C lang and Java with universal documentation for each algorithm to be applied with all languages.

## Contributing
