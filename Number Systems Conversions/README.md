<p align="center">
    In a positional number system, there are only a few symbols called digits. A digit is an alphanumeric symbol, used in combinations, to represent numbers in positional number systems. These symbols represent diâ†µerent values depending upon the position they occupy in a number. (Hence, the prefix positional). <br><br>Here, we discuss four common positional number systems: decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
These systems are classified according to the values of the base of the number system.

## About Number Systems

Here, we discuss four common positional number systems: decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.

- <span style="color:red">**_The Binary Number System_**</span> :- The base of the binary system is 2 and it is composed of 2 numerals or symbols. These 2 symbols are <span style="color:green">0</span> and <span style="color:green">1</span>; using these symbols as digits of a number, we can express any quantity.

- <span style="color:red"> **_The Decimal Number System_**</span> :- The base of the decimal system is 10 and it is composed of 10 numerals or symbols. These 10 symbols are <span style="color:green">0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</span>; using these symbols as digits of a number, we can express any quantity.

- <span style="color:red">**_The Octal Number System_**</span> :- The base of the octal system is 8 and it is composed of 7 numerals or symbols. These 7 symbols are <span style="color:green">0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</span>; using these symbols as digits of a number, we can express any quantity.

- <span style="color:red"> **_The Hexadecimal Number System_**</span> :- The base of the hexadecimal system is 16. The hexadecimal number system has 16 alphanumeric symbols: from <span style="color:green">0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F</span>. Here A is 10, B is 11, C is 12, D is 13, E is 14 and F is 15.

## Binary <--> Decimal

- <span style="color:red">**_The Binary Number System_**</span> :- The base of the binary system is 2 and it is composed of 2 numerals or symbols; 1 & 2.
- <span style="color:red"> **_The Decimal Number System_**</span> :- The base of the decimal system is 10 and it is composed of 10 numerals or symbols; 0 - 9.

### Binary to Decimal

| **_(1)_** | Determine the positional value of each binary digit (i.e., the associated weight of the digit).    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_(2)_** | Multiply each binary digit by its weight (Ex: 1 \* 2^2).                                           |
| **_(3)_** | Sum the products calculated in Step 2. The total is the value of the number in the decimal system. |

### Decimal to Binary

#### Converting a Decimal Number to another System (Integers)

| **_(1)_** | Divide the decimal integer to be converted by the new base (2) for binary.                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_(2)_** | The remainder from Step 1 will be the least significant digit in the new-base number.       |
| **_(3)_** | Divide the quotient from Step 2 by the new base. This will be the next digit (to the left). |
| **_(4)_** | Repeat Steps 1 - 3 until the quotient of the division is zero.                              |

#### Converting a Decimal Number to another System (A Fraction between 0 and 1)

| **_(1)_** | Multiply the decimal fraction to be converted by the new base (2) for binary.                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_(2)_** | The integer part from Step 1 is the most significant digit in the new-base number                   |
| **_(3)_** | Multiply the fraction part from Step 2 by the new base. This will be the next digit (to the right). |
| **_(4)_** | Repeat Steps 1 - 3 until the fraction becomes zero.                                                 |
