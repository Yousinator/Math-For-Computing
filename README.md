## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://d2r55xnwy6nx47.cloudfront.net/uploads/2019/04/Multiplication_1920x1080_Lede.gif)


These are Mathematical algorithms that are used in the programming field. All algorithms are written in both C and Java. For each folder that contains more than one algorithm, there will be a separate file for each algorithm with precise documentation on how the algorithm was written.



## ðŸ’¡Detailed INFO:

``` Number Systems Calculator -> The number systems calculator converts numbers from system to system. The code is available both in C and Java. In Progress... ```
##
``` Symmetric Encryption -> It includes a code that encrypts messages symmetrically (Public Key Encryption). In Progress... ```
##
``` RSA Encryption -> Includes a code that performs RSA Encryption using the modular inverse (Public & Private Key Encryption). In Progress... ```
##
``` Sequences -> In Progress... ```
##
``` Hashing -> In Progress... ```

For this project, I used both C lang and Java. The C code is mainly for me as I like the language and I want to use it. As for Java, I used it to provide a GUI for each code.

## Getting Started

Getting started with this repository is very simple. You can just navigate to the section you'd like to check out and you'll find documentation for each algorithm in its specific file. Each topic will have a java joint GUI program.

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to be familiar with the algorithms you are checking out as algorithms won't be explained mathematically. Documentation will only include an explanation from a programming perspective. 

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```
2. Viola that's it!!


## Usage

This repository can be used with specific projects that require certain mathematical algorithms. This repo has the algorithms written in both C lang and Java with universal documentation for each algorithm to be applied with all languages.

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
